Polymer Property Prediction using Molecular Feature Engineering and Machine Learning:

This project blends **computational chemistry** with **machine learning** to predict polymer properties using molecular structure data.  
It was developed for the **NeurIPS 2025 Open Polymer Prediction Challenge**, aiming to extract deep chemical insights through feature engineering and ensemble learning.

Project Overview:

Traditional machine learning models struggle with chemical data because raw molecular identifiers fail to capture real-world interactions.  
To solve this, I engineered a chemistry-aware pipeline that transforms molecular representations into rich, interpretable features, then uses advanced boosting models to predict target polymer properties.
